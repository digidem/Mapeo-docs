# Preparing Computer

## Prepare Computer for Packaging the Categories

This is a one time process for every computer. We will need to iinstall nvm, npm, and homebrew. If you've already done this, skip this section.

### Install nvm

```sh
touch ~/.bash_profile
```

```sh
curl -o- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.32.1/install.sh> | bash
```

Then close terminal and open again

### Install homebrew \(macOS\)

[http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh/)

### Install npm

[https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)

### Install and use node 12

```sh
nvm install 12
nvm alias default 12
```

### Install Mapeo Settings Builder

You'll see output on the terminal, but this is OK

```sh
npm install -g mapeo-settings-builder
```

## Is your computer ready?

If your computer is ready to create configurations, type

```sh
mapeo-settings-builder
```

You should see output that looks something like

```sh
â†’ Using version x.x.x of mapeo-settings-builder
